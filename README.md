# zztools
zztools can set up a system to your preferences, no matter what os it is, all with a single config
## The need
if you switch distros a lot or have to set up your system a lot, you'll sometimes get tired of always configuring everything yourself. zztools can do all of that for you, in one command and one config, no matter what os you use
## Installation
Unfortunately, right now, zztools isn't available in any repository yet. That is soon going to change. To install it, just clone this repository, and run `python zztools.py -h` to get a help. Since the wiki isn't finished done yet, you'll have to make due with the program help.
## Configuration
For configuration, see the [wiki](https://github.com/ZofiaZementa/zztools/wiki)
## Contributing
If you want to contribute, just fork the repo and then make a pull request. I'll also set up a `Contributing.md` in the next few days.
