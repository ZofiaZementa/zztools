# zztools
zztools can set up a system to your preferences, no matter what os it is, all with a single config
## The need
if you switch distros a lot or have to set up your system a lot, you'll sometimes get tired of always configuring everything yourself. zztools can do all of that for you, in one command and one config, no matter what os you use
## Installation
Unfortunately, right now, zztools isn't available in any repository yet. That is soon going to change. To install it, just clone this repository, and run `python zztools.py -h` to get a help. Since the wiki isn't finished done yet, you'll have to make due with the program help.
## Configuration
Since the wiki isn't done yet, there's not really anything you can do right now to figure out how to configure zztools, except read the source code or write me. This will hopefully change in the next few days
## Contributing
If you want to contribute, just fork the repo and then make a pull request. I'll also set up a `Contributing.md` in the next few days.
